# CNC Milling Machine
- Designed and built a desktop CNC milling machine. 
- Used SolidWorks to provide high-level dimensions of each structural component, and to check for interferences.
- Confirmed electronics (not shown) and CNC software mimic actual designed components. 
- Used global variables and a logical mate pattern of components to ensure model self-updates properly if major dimensions were modified (ie. Parametric design)<br>
